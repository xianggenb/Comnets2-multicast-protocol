# Comnets2-multicast-protocol
Rutgers comnets2 final project


In computer networks, multicasting is sending data to multiple users in a single transmission.
The multiple recipients are usually part of a multicast group. The clients subscribe to a particular
multicast session and are given an ID. Clients with the same ID are part of a Multicast group.

we detail a method to implement multicast to achieve best case delivery. That
is if the number of recipients are n, we try to deliver to a best destinations of k out of n. In our
case, we limited the number of destinations to 3 and k can take a value of 1,2 or 3, which is
provided by the user
